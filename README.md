# Flower_Recognition
* this is a computer vision project based on google's flowers data set ("https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz")
* building a model to classify images of flowers into 5 classes
* the model is Convolution Neural Network that uses 3 convolution and maxpooling layers along with 1 dense layer and 1 output layer
* data augmentation and dropout layers are used to minimize overfitting 
* the model achieves 84% accuracy with validation data
